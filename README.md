# Boggle

This is a Java implementation of the popular Boggle board game.

By entering the contents of your Boggle board, this program will show you all the words that could have been found.

Optionally, you and your friends can enter all the words you found while playing a game. This program can then give you the following information:
* Words you thought you found (but actually are not on the Boggle Board)
* Things you thought were words (and still might be in your imagination)
